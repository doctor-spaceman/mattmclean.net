      I became interested in technology during childhood, inspired by science fiction and the staggering rate of invention leading into the Internet age. I grew up playing video games and watching special effects become more and more impressive; built websites around my interests; and taught myself how to use image editing and 3D software packages. After earning an undergraduate degree in Engineering Technology, I worked as a Computer-Aided Design Technician in the automotive industry before pursuing a graduate degree.

        Meaningful interactive experiences encourage us to reflect on our inner selves and our place in the world.

      Still captivated by narratives of technology helping to unite humanity and create a better world, I joined the Entertainment Technology program at Carnegie Mellon University, which opened the doors to contributing on a wide variety of digital interactive projects. I wholeheartedly believe that technology allows us to have and share amazing experiences that would not be possible otherwise.
